Heya and Welcome! A bit of a virtual tour (constructed/edited by a number of members).
#general and #random are really both random, with the distinction that #general is where we organize meetups when it’s not a pandemic out there
#politics is very active
#covid19 is quite topical, discuss current science, and daily case number reporting for Maine
#food, it’s spin-off #baking, and #booze (to keep food reasonably alcohol-free) are very popular and full of people with very firm opinions on these topics
#weather because it’s New England and we can’t not talk about weather and Keith Carson’s tweets
#homeowners for discussion of things related to taking care of properties
#local-services, #local-gear, #local-tech-jobs are very useful places to holler for recommendations or referrals. A recommendation spreadsheet is linked from the topic of #local-services.
#finance is for personal finance chat/learnings, and #business is for the business owners among us
#simcity and #portland_flag are arguably where we have the most fun, because fun is nerding out about design, urban density, and making fun of SOBs
There’s also a few #code related channels, but for an ostensibly tech-related slack chat, we aren’t all *that* active anywhere about tech. 
Another recent addition is #cinema where, despite it’s name, we tend to discuss all manner of highbrow and mainstream movies and television shows
#tricked-out-office is for all the tips, tricks, hacks, and gear you use to make sure your daily desk is as efficient & well-appointed as the average broadcast studio.
If you like being out on the water, there's #boats :sailboat: to discuss vessels and local waters, and #fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish: for anybody interested in learning about the sport or sharing their (only slightly exaggerated) tales.

There’s more channels, but ideally that gives you a few more signposts along the way! 

Lastly, we do have some loose conduct rules which you can find in The Rules section here: http://caportland.me/ If you have any issues or questions, please contact anyone listed on that site in The People section.
